# 🎙️ Speech-to-Text AI Converter

A powerful, Python-based AI project that converts human speech into readable text in real-time. This full-stack voice-to-text assistant demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence, speech recognition, and user-friendly interfaces. Built for aspiring developers, voice assistants, and accessibility tools.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project captures audio input via microphone or uploaded file and converts it into text using Python's speech recognition capabilities. It can be used for note-taking, meeting transcription, accessibility tools, and voice-driven applications. The project showcases how AI and NLP can simplify everyday tasks.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- To build a lightweight and efficient AI assistant that listens to spoken language and transcribes it into text.
- To explore speech processing and integrate it with Python for practical applications.
- To provide a real-time experience using simple UI frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 Real-time audio-to-text conversion
- 🧠 Uses intelligent speech recognition libraries
- 🌐 Web UI built with Flask or Streamlit (optional)
- 📁 Upload audio files (.wav) and convert instantly
- 🔊 Sample audio included for testing
- 📜 Easy-to-read and edit transcript output
- 🛠️ Modular and reusable helper functions
- 💡 Clean code structure and beginner-friendly

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- `SpeechRecognition` — core STT engine
- `PyAudio` — microphone input handling
- `Flask` or `Streamlit` — for web interface (optional)
- `Wave` — audio file manipulation
- `Textwrap`, `os`, `time` — utility functions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-ai.git
   cd speech-to-text-ai

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:

python main.py



Optional:
If using Streamlit UI:

streamlit run app.py
